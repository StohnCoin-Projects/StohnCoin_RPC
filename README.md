This is a basic application that shows how to do basic tasks using C# talking to a Stohn Coin Node via RPC.  This same C# code can be used to make a REST API, or a Windows Service!  This code relies heavily on the already existing BitNet Bitcoin RPC Client.  It does not include every single Stohn Coin RPC Call but it should have a enough to get you started.  There is a section in one of the files that indicates where you can add more RPC method calls.  Since stohn Coin is based on Bitcoin a lot of the research can be done using Bitcoin RPC call code.
